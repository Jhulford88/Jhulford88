### Hello, my name is Joshua ðŸ‘‹

Drawing upon my extensive background in process engineering, manufacturing, and the food and beverage industry, I offer a distinct viewpoint when it comes to Software Engineering. Through my proficiency in understanding user behavior and dissecting intricate systems, I possess the ability to craft user-friendly interfaces and construct robust applications that precisely meet users' requirements. By capitalizing on my knowledge in process engineering, I thrive in collaborative settings, working seamlessly with diverse teams to deliver top-notch software solutions that have a positive impact. Transitioning from the realm of food and beverage to Software Engineering has endowed me with a well-rounded skill set, enabling me to bridge the divide between technology and human experiences. Consequently, I am able to develop meaningful and user-centric software products that truly resonate with individuals.
